# AI in Healthcare: The 2024 Revolution

![AI Healthcare Applications](https://example.com/ai-healthcare.jpg){.featured-image}  
*AI applications across the healthcare spectrum*

## 1. Drug Discovery Accelerated

```python
# AI drug discovery pipeline
def generate_drug_candidates(target):
    # Generate molecular structures
    candidates = generative_model.predict(target)
    # Filter by properties
    return filter(candidates, 
                solubility=0.5,
                toxicity=0.1,
                binding_affinity=0.8)
```

**2024 Impact**:
- 300% more AI-designed drugs in trials
- Development time cut by 70%
- Cost reductions of 40-60%
