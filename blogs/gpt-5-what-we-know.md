*Conceptual diagram of expected GPT-5 architecture improvements*

## Expected Features and Capabilities

The AI community is abuzz with speculation about GPT-5, the likely successor to GPT-4. Based on reliable sources:

```python
# Simplified mixture-of-experts pseudocode
def forward(input):
    expert_weights = gating_network(input)
    output = 0
    for expert, weight in zip(experts, expert_weights):
        output += weight * expert(input)
    return output
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Reasoning Ability**  
   - Complex problem solving
   - Logical consistency
   - Mathematical proofs

2. **Memory Enhancements**  
   - Cross-session memory
   - User-specific adaptation
   - Context compression
